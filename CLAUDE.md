# Claude Code Instructions

## Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: Always push changes to git after making code changes. Both apps deploy automatically:

- **Vercel**: https://gdays.vercel.app/ - Auto-deploys on push to `main`
- **GitHub Pages**: https://shailenparmar.github.io/good-days/ - Auto-deploys via GitHub Actions on push to `main`

After any code changes:
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

## Project Structure

- `src/features/` - Feature-based modules (auth, journal, theme, settings, statistics, export)
- `src/shared/` - Shared utilities and components
- `src/index.css` - Global styles including scrollbar-hide utility

## UI Conventions

- All scrollable areas should use `scrollbar-hide` class to hide scrollbars
- Theme colors are HSL-based and managed via ThemeContext
- Borders use 6px solid with theme color at 0.85 opacity

## Tech Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Electron (for desktop app in `/electron`)
